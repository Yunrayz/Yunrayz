### generative-content-smart-room

Made with Unity. It's a game supposed to be played by two children, between 6 and 12, with a typical or atypical developpment. The game was developped to be played in a Magic Room, a place equipped with a Kinect System tracking the movements of the players, and two screen projected on the floor and on a wall. In this highly immersive experience, they will need to collaborate to discover everything about their environment, wich has a lot to offer.
