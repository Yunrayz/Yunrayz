### Humanbusters

Made with Unity. A 2D game entirely made by a 5 students team. You are a little cute ghost that is starting its terrific journey by trying to scare the neighborhood. Here is a [gameplay footage](https://youtu.be/4UKzsBFSgks) if you want to discover more about it.

### generative-content-smart-room

Made with Unity. It's a game supposed to be played by two children, between 6 and 12, with a typical or atypical developpment. The game was developped to be played in a Magic Room, a place equipped with a Kinect System tracking the movements of the players, and two screen projected on the floor and on a wall. In this highly immersive experience, they will need to collaborate to discover everything about their environment, wich has a lot to offer. Here is a [short video](https://youtu.be/afiMRngNa0w) showing a bit of the project.
